The Amazon River is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world, and by some definitions, it is the longest.
It flows through South America, primarily through Brazil, Peru, and Colombia.
Its drainage basin is the largest in the world, about 7.05 million square kilometers (2.72 million square miles).
The Amazon rainforest, which it flows through, is the largest tropical rainforest on Earth.
Deforestation in the Amazon is a significant environmental concern, impacting biodiversity and climate.
Many unique species of flora and fauna, including the pink river dolphin and various types of monkeys, inhabit the Amazon.
The river's source is generally considered to be in the Andes Mountains of Peru.
